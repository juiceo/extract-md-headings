# Contributing

First off, I have to thank you for wanting to contributing to this project. You rock ðŸ¤˜! Please go through the process below.

## Getting Started

When you're done with the step above, cd (change directory) into the project folder

```bash
cd extract-md-headings
```

- Set the remote upstream of your forked repository to the base repository (i.e. the original repository)

```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/kaf-lamed-beyt/extract-md-headings.git
```

- Create a branch and start working on your feature.

```bash
    git checkout -b [branch-name]
```

- Save and commit your changes

```bash
    git add --all

    git commit -m "your message"
```

    git push origin [branch name]
```
